/* Solenoid controlled Brakes.
 * * Solenoid (Johnson Electic model 150 174432-024) 
 * can be kept at lower voltage (12V) indefinitely. 
 * It has a holding force of 14.5 lb.
 * At the higher voltage, data sheet expects it to be high (24V) for
 * 25% of the time and low for 75%. However, it can stay high for 100 sec.
 * The solenoid typically reacts in less than a second.
 * For 0.25 inch throw and 24V it can pull 7 lb.
 * We are using the part with 0.3 inch throw, 12V in low state and 24V in high
 * state, but keeping voltage high for only a second or two.
 *   
 * The solenoids are controlled by relays on two digital lines.
 * * Tyler Folsom   April 2018   
 * * * Expected behavior
 * * When Green LED is on, NO is connected to COM; NC is not
 * * Writing HIGH to a relay will turn LED on, and connect NO to COM
 * * When green LED is off, NC is connected to COM; NO is not.
 * * Writing LOW to a relay will turn LED off, and connect NC to COM.
 * * You shoud hear a click when the relay operates.
 * * If there is a change in LED, but no click, the relay does not have enough power.
